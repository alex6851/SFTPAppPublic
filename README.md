# SFTPAppPublic
This is a version of the code that has had all security related information removed so that is safe for the public
Since this is a Sanitized version of the original code you won't see any Git history either.


This is an App that I wrote for the Globalcapes SFTP program called EFT it is written in C#.

The app is used to create users, folders, and security groups.

It then assigns those security groups to the proper folders and gives them the proper permissions.
